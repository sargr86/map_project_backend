                                                        Shipping your luggage can save you time, energy and money.
                                                        Schlepping your luggage around the airport could be very inconvenient and time consuming.
                                                        You may spend lot of time on luggage check-in and claims. Airline procedures are prone to be burdensome and may charge more money for your oversized luggage.
                                                        The Airlines are also prone to improper handling of your shipment which could damage your luggage, or you can even lose your belongings.
                                                        To avoid any unpleasant experiences during you trip, ship your luggage, and have your luggage wait for you at the destination even before your arrival

                                                        We strongly suggest customer to double check their payment information before submission.
                                                        However, there are many other reasons lead to credit card decline:

                                                    <p>-  There are not enough funds on your card.</p>
                                                    <p>-  The credit card is not open international transactions (non-US credit cards only)</p>
                                                    <p>-  The credit card issued bank has place high levels of security measures on your card.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Because the issued bank usually will not provide us detailed information as to why your credit card was declined,
                                                        please contact your bank to resolve this issue.

                                                        After your shipment is picked up, the carrier will measure the actual size and weight of each luggage/bag/box.
                                                        Once the shipment is delivered, the carrier company will bill the shipping fee at the actual chargeable weight which is the greater
                                                        of the total actual weight versus total dimensional weight.
                                                        The formula to calculate the dimensional weight (pound) of your luggage is length (inch) * width (inch) * height (inch) / 139.

                                                        If the final chargeable weight of your bag exceeds the maximum weight
                                                        of the luggage, box, ski or golf bag type you selected, we have to charge you for the shipping fee of the weight
                                                        difference. To avoid weight difference fees, visit our

In most cases, this will allow used personal effects to enter the country without custom delay.

We recommend customers to provide all information customer asked to have the shipment to be released as early as possible.

                                                        If you travel and send your used personal effects or sport equipment ahead, it will be a great idea to provide the custom authority of the destination your passport and visa copies. The customs of the destination country may require a copy of the consignee passport and visa to confirm the goods that are intended for personal use and have no commercial value or are not intended for other purposes. In most cases, this will allow used personal effects to enter the country without custom delay.

                                                        If you travel and ship your used personal effects or sport equipment, we recommend our customers to provide the travel itinerary to the customs authority. Clearing personal effects through customs is different from clearing a commercial shipment. The customs authority will require proof that the owner of the goods intends to remain the owner. The easiest and quickest way to demonstrate that you intend to remain with the items is to show that you have travelled with them, or plan to do so in the future.

                                                        After your shipment is picked up, the carrier will measure the actual size and weight of each luggage/bag/box. Once the shipment is delivered, the carrier company will bill the shipping fee at the actual chargeable weight which is the greater of the total actual weight versus total dimensional weight. The formula to calculate the dimensional weight (pound) of your luggage is length (inch) * width (inch) * height (inch) / 139.
                                                    </p>

                                                        If the finial chargeable weight of your bag exceeds the maximum weight of the item type you selected, we have to charge the shipping fee of the weight difference. To avoid the weight difference, please visit our  <a href="<?php echo base_url('luggage-weight');?>" class="blue-color" target="_blank">Shipping Weight and Size</a> to find the correct size of your item(s).
